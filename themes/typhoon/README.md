# Typhoon Theme

**Typhoon** for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) is a highly flexible theme that is built on top of the modern [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework.  The theme provides a flexible architecture for building beautiful sites and serves as a great base for custom theme designs.  It makes use of the powerful theme variable system available in Grav to set global defaults and then override those at a page level.
