Each article or chapter I read gets an entry into my `Articles` database. The main view is a list of all articles, sorted alphabetically by author. I also have tremendous flexibility to create other views as well.

Each view is the same database, but sorted, filtered, and displayed differently. For example, the view below is the database displayed on a kanban board grouped by the `Method` tag.
