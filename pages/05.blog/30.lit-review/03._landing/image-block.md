Here is how I have Notion structured right now. My landing page starts with a kanban board of tasks for the week. These tasks are just like you would see in other kanban systems like Asana, Trello, etc. in that they can be assigned to people, can host conversations, and be manually dragged from one column to another.

The items representing the first three chapters of my dissertation, `Introduction`, `Lit review`, and `Methods`, are examples of how Notion is integrated. The little arrow indicates that they are linked, in this case to a separate database I've created called `Timeline`. Not only are those items showing up in my kanban board as 'ToDo', but they are also *where* I do the doing. So each of those items is a weekly todo, an item on a Gantt chart, and a page where I actually draft my writing.

You can also see that there are other items linked, but those ones are linked to another database called `Articles`.
