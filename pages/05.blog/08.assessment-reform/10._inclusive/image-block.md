### ... interim assessment results used for feedback on learning and progress do not play a significant role in determining students’ final grades.
For purposes of certification, care must be taken to avoid the formal use of early grades that do not represent the outcomes reached by course or program completion. Entry-level knowledge, learning rates and final achievement levels differ. Although learning itself is cumulative, progressively adding marks throughout the learning period towards the final grade can distort representation of end-of-study achievement. What is important is using interim outcomes to improve learning.

### ... evidence of overall achievement to determine final grades is based on assessment of integrated learning
Many separate low-value pieces of assessment can fragment learning without providing evidence of how students’ knowledge and skills from a unit of study are interrelated. This is often compounded across subjects, leading students to experience knowledge as disconnected elements. Strong evidence of achievement of the totality of outcomes can be provided by larger-scale tasks that require students to demonstrate coherent integrated learning, not isolated or atomistic performance.

### ... certification accurately and richly portrays graduates’ and students’ achievements to inform future careers and learning.
An academic transcript that lists subject titles and grades provides limited information to students, employers or educational institutions. Increased scope and sophistication of the reporting of achievement is needed to communicate outcomes well. Two areas for improvement are: veracity, in grades that are fully and robustly aligned with learning outcomes and standards; and, richness, in the documentation of student accomplishments to convey information about what students can and cannot do.
