### Suggestions for use
These propositions can be used to focus debate and action on those features of assessment that have the greatest impact on learning and the quality of courses.
They might be most productively used by:
- planning teams and program directors in new course design and course review and renewal
- teaching and learning committees and academic boards, institutionally and locally
- groups of Associate Deans and Directors of Teaching and Learning within and across Faculties
- those running courses and workshops for academic staff on assessment, and particularly within Graduate Certificates in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education
- those running leadership programs to ensure that leaders at all levels have a strong appreciation of assessment issues and directions
- those with academic development roles who consult with staff and course teams
- those guiding staff-student discussions about the improvement of courses

The challenge is to consider how these might be best pursued within existing cost constraints. This must necessarily involve deciding which assessment tasks should be discontinued in order to provide space for more worthwhile initiatives.
