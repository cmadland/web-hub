You can see the metadata that I create around each article as a way to help organize things. I suspect that if I were trying to do a PhD before digital technologies, I would be significantly less organized.

Many people use Zotero or other citation management tools, and those are indispensable and a key part of my workflow. However, I find the interface for metadata to be clunky, and searching and sorting are downright awful.

The most important part of this process is extracting `Key Ideas` from each article, which get entered into another database, called `Synthesis Matrix`. BTW, these databases are all connected, so when Ivcreate a `Key Idea` entry in the metadata of an article, that also creates that same item in the `Synthesis Matrix` database. So a full `item` in one database, say `Synthesis Matrix` is a `property` in another database like `Articles`.
