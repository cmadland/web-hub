So that is my quick overview of my lit review workflow and knowledge management system. I do recommend Notion with the following caveats:
1. Notion right now is 'online only'. There is no offline editing mode like you can get with a git/grav/atom workflow. This means that you need to ensure that you have a system where you regularly export your workspace and keep a backup in multiple physical and online locations.
2. The export options are limited to Markdown and CSV, which is great for keeping backups and such, BUT those exports cannot be used to recreate your workspace. Importing an export would just get you a disconnected set of text files with hyperlinks to notion.
3. It does take some time to sort through Notion and the workflow is very different from previous options (spreadsheets, google docs, task manager). If you already have a system in those tools and you are well into your research, think very carefully about how much effort and time you can put into learning Notion and reorganizing your entire workflow. However, if you are just starting out and are looking for a system and don't mind the time it takes to get sorted, it is  a great option.
