Clicking the `purpose of assessment` item in the `Key Ideas` section of the article metadata takes me to an item in the `Synthesis Matrix` database, where I gather all my notes about that key idea.

You can see in the `Sources` property, links back to the article database corresponding to each article that references the `purpose of assessment` key idea.

Below that, you can see several toggles, each opening up to all my notes, pull quotes (with page numbers, which are highlighted in the PDF stored in Zotero). The titles of the toggles are also hyperlinked to the article items in the `Articles` database.
