As expected, my process is evolving. As a PhD student in Educational Technology, I think it is important to be messing around with tools as they show up in the market. Obviously, I can't try everything because new edtech tools proliferate and grow like weeds. And like weeds, which are invasive plants growing in places they don't belong, many edtech tools are invasive (in more ways than one) and they don't belong in education. I digress.
