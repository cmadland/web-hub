As expected, my process is evolving. As a PhD student in Educational Technology, I think it is important to be messing around with tools as they show up in the market. Obviously, I can't try everything because new edtech tools proliferate and grow like weeds. And like weeds, which are invasive plants growing in places they don't belong, many edtech tools are invasive (in more ways than one) and they don't belong in education. I digress.

Usually I will find a tool because I am trying to do something that isn't supported in a current tool that I'm using. An example is my [Lit Workflow which I wrote about here](https://madland.ca/blog/lit-workflow). I really dig being able to compose stuff in Markdown and have everything backed up to GitHub and multiple hard drives. One thing that was inconvenient about that workflow is that visualizing connections between ideas was challenging because Grav is a flat-file system. Also, I didn't have a good tool to build a synthesis matrix for my lit review. If you search the Googles for 'synthesis matrix', you will get a whole boatload of examples of matrices built in spreadsheets, which is the tool that enabled the process in the first place, so it is understandable to see a bunch of spreadsheets.

So, I started looking for a tool that was Markdown based, allowed me to back up to git and could make the synthesis matrix process smoother than a truly massive spreadsheet. I found [Notion.so](https://notion.so). Notion bills itself as an 'all-in-one workspace' for collaboration; it allows me to compose in Markdown, or not; it has a free upgrade for higher ed users; I can export to MD and CSV; I can share on my terms; and it is super flexible. One of the distinct advantages for the synthesis matrix is that Notion allows me to build relational databases super easily, in contrast with Grav and in many ways with spreadsheet software.
