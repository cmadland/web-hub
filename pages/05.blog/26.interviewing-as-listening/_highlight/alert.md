### Field Note

###### Interview with Daryl Davis

This was a rich interview with a narrative arc that followed Davis' life as a talented musician with a unique tactic for wresting KKK members from the organization through loving and respectful dialogue. Davis comes across as an extraordinarily calm and confident individual, possibly a persona honed through years of performing, and certainly tested in countless conversations with people who hate him.

The questions in the interview were very much what you would expect from someone familiar with their subject, but also someone who is genuinely curious and surprised at some answers. Piya does a good job of setting the context of Daryl's life, and revisits the emotions that she experiences a few times through the interview. Mostly, Piya seems surprised, even to the point of being a bit flustered as she can't even imagine putting herself into Daryl's situation of being in conversation with people who hate her because of who she is. I think this serves to keep the interview lighter than it might have been as there is a sense of wonder at the fortitude that Daryl displays on such a regular basis. Piya returns to this at the very end of the interview when she asks Scott where his old robe is, and he responds with 'Daryl has it'.

This sense of wonder and curiosity really shine through in Piya's unscripted moments, exclamations, and questions. It is clear that Piya is deeply engaged with Daryl's and Scott's stories and that her reactions are genuine and stem from careful listening to what each of her subjects is saying.
