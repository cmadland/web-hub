### Revisiting this post...

Back in October 2018, I published this post that was a little critical of synchronous f2f learning environments. I have further thoughts...

Early in the course, I was feeling the difference between my fully online and asynchronous MEd, and being 'back in class'. It was odd.

By the end of that course, it was much more clear where the trajectory of the course had us going. Each of the assessments was one step along the way to publishing a paper. We started with a concept analysis, moved to a conference abstract (where we could use our concept analysis and build it into an concise abstract), then a conference proposal, and finally a conference paper. By the end of it all, we had worked through a sample workflow for a researcher, albeit quite generalized.

Looking back now, I'm grateful for the course and for the careful, measured, and highly professional approach taken by our prof. By any number of objective measures, it was an excellent class. Each session was very well-planned, learners were engaged, our prof was well-tuned to the energy levels in the class and adjusted accordingly, assessments were scaffolded and fair and we received lots of high-quality feedback along with opportunities to 'revise and resubmit'.

Another characteristic of the class was that one student was not able to attend weekly meetings but was able to connect to the class via Skype. This added an extra layer of complexity that our prof had to manage, but he was willing to experiment and was gracious in managing the process.

While this was arguably a 'traditional' class scheduled for 3-hour weekly meetings, it was humanized by a prof who modeled professionalism and a deep concern for having each of us succeed.

I think one of the things that indicated to me that this was a great class was the fact that many of us were in the same course in the winter semester and returning after Christmas was like a bit of a reunion, and we missed those who weren't in the class while we welcomed some new faces.
