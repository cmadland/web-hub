Inclusion and cultural acceptance of LGBTQ students and staff is *still* a problem and this article highlights some of the challenges faced by members of the LGBTQ community infinding support, promoting acceptance in public, and avoiding 'outing' those who need confidential support but who may be harmed if the broader community is aware of their identity.

===

This ethnographic account of an LGBTQ activist group in a high school in New Zealand is an insightful look into the challenges faced by youth today.

Desiring and advocating for acceptance and inclusion sometimes harms people who aren't ready for public 'performances' of their gender of sexual identity and encouraging disclosure of pronouns can lead to pressure.

Another challenge noted in the article is that both authors identify as cis-gendered heterosexuals, leading to issues of trust with the group of LGBTQ youth that needed to be overcome and acknowledged.
