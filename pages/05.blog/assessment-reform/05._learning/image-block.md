# ... feedback is used to actively improve student learning.

### ... feedback is informative and supportive and facilitates a positive attitude to future learning.
Students benefit from clear and helpful feedback on their learning. Everyday learning activities as well as special tasks and tests provide opportunities for the provision of feedback. This places responsibility on staff to plan assessment in order to (a) develop their own skills in providing quality feedback, and (b) develop in students the skills they need to provide sound feedback to each other.

### ... students seek and use timely feedback to improve the quality of their learning and work.
Studentsâ€™ own skills of judgement are developed by their utilisation of feedback, guidance provided by those already inducted into the culture and standards of the discipline, and opportunities to grow their own skills of critical appraisal. They need to be able to seek and employ feedback from a variety of sources to develop a full range of outcomes from their studies.

### ... students regularly receive specific information, not just marks and grades, about how to improve the quality of their work.
Marks and grades provide little information to students about specific qualities of their work and do not indicate how it
might be improved. While marks and grades may provide a crude tracking measure of how well students are doing, they do not help students move beyond their present standard of performance. Specific and detailed information is needed to show students what has been done well, what has not, and how their work could be better.
