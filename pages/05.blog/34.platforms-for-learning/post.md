Often I find that there is an inordinate amount of interest in particular technology tools and their inevitable disruption of higher education. If only we would all use [Prezi/Padlet/Minecraft/Twitter/Grav] more in our teaching, higher ed as we know it would be revolutionized! Maybe that's a little extra, but I think many of us have been there (both receiving and giving the hype).

===

It's easy to catch the hype, and I'm not here to bash those who do, nor am I here to throw shade at any particular tool. The ones I listed above the break can all be used well or poorly in online learning [well, maybe not Prezi]. What I would like to suggest is that it is far too easy, as [@scottmacklin](https://twitter.com/scottmacklin) mentioned today, to fight about whose preferred tool is best at doing whatever, and so maybe we could benefit from a different focus.

I'm certainly not the first to suggest this, but perhaps we should look a little deeper than the logistics of learning activities that are enabled by particular tools and explore the underlying infrastructure upon which it is all built.

[Kwet, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/0306396818823172) highlights the stark parallels between the dark colonial past (and present) of South Africa where Europeans created a system of economic domination by controlling the architecture of commercial enterprises and modern day 'investments' in technology by US-based tech monopolies. One way they accomplished this was by building railways that originated in the gold and diamond mines and travelled directly to ports on the coast, bypassing local towns who would have benefitted from being involved in the supply chain. Instead, all of the profits went directly back to Europe. This might be called `extractive resource capitalism` and it has been a tool for colonization from the very beginning of colonialism.

Today, GAFAM (Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) owns a significant amount of the technological infrastructure in SA and so the profits from their surveillance flow directly back to the new empire of the US. Kwet reports that 70% of advertising revenues in SA go directly to Google, 12% go to Facebook, and only 8% to local SA companies. We can think of this model as `extractive surveillance capitalism`, a new and improved form of colonial capitalism.

GAFAM engages in surveillance capitalism by controlling the three pillars of technological infrastructure: software, hardware, and network connectivity.

At the software level, companies control what users are able to do through licensing agreements, Digital Rights Management (DRM), proprietary algorithms and code that users cannot see, understand, change, or share, and by tightly controlling which software can run on which hardware.

Hardware controls are enacted by physically designing hardware in such a way that software cannot be changed, and more recently by encouraging, even forcing, users to outsource computing power to proprietary servers. For example, if a Facebook user wants to perform an action in the Fb software, they must perform that action on Fb servers. Similarly, Google Docs and MS Office 365 users must outsource computing power and functions to centralized and proprietary servers. Both Google and Microsoft expend enormous resources ensuring that the default and easiest method of using their software is to use it on their servers. This ensures that as much data as possible can be extracted from users.

While Apple's business model is less reliant on user data (according to Apple), their control over hardware and software combined with their massive popularity mean that they can exert colonial influence through planned obsolescence. Once a computer or mobile device is sold and delivered to an end user, it is extremely difficult to update the hardware, even the battery, which is often glued into the chassis of the device. This means that users will be able to update their software to the point that newer versions of the software will not run on the old hardware, pressuring them to purchase new hardware.

Both Apple and Google promote centralized computing power, meaning that they can sell hardware that is less capable than it otherwise would have been. Apple does this by making base models of their hardware only moderately capable, then charging steep premiums on 'extra' memory and processor speed. Google sells extremely limited hardware that can only run their software, forcing users to outsource the vast majority of their computing needs.

Finally GAFAM has begun exerting colonial dominance through ownership of the network itself. An example of this is Facebook's initiative deceptively called `internet.org`. The `.org` top-level domain is an almost universal signifier of a non-profit organization, but internet.org is far from a humanitarian non-profit. Instead, it is a network that allows people in areas that have few internet connections available to connect to 'the internet' for free. While this sounds like a good thing, connections are limited to only companies and websites that are whitelisted by Facebook. User access to other sites is either completely restricted or prohibitively expensive. This practice is known as `zero-rating` and is a method that GAFAM uses to control what users can see on the 'internet'. For some users, the only internet that they know is Facebook.
