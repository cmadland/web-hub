Read this article yesterday...

!!!! Gerritsen-van Leeuwenkamp, K. J., Joosten-ten Brinke, D., & Kester, L. (2017). Assessment quality in tertiary education: An integrative literature review. *Studies in Educational Evaluation, 55*, 94â€“116. [https://doi.org/10/ghjbhx](https://doi.org/10/ghjbhx)

Here's the abstract...

> In tertiary education, inferior assessment quality is a problem that has serious consequences for students, teachers, government, and society. A lack of a clear and overarching conceptualisation of assessment quality can cause difficulties in guaranteeing assessment quality. Thus, the aim of this study is to conceptualise assessment quality in tertiary education by providing an overview of the assessment quality criteria, their influences, the evaluation of the assessment quality criteria, and the perspectives that should be considered when evaluating assessment quality. This study aggregated 78 peer-reviewed journal articles in a framework using MAXQDA, and a text analysis was performed using Leximancer. The results identified validity, transparency, and reliability as assessment quality criteria; standardisation, stakeholders, clarity, and construct irrelevant variance as influences on the assessment quality criteria; validation and statistical data analyses to evaluate assessment quality; and students, staff, government, and experts as perspectives that should be considered when evaluating assessment quality. These insights are important for teachers, educational advisors, and managers who can use this in- formation to determine what assessment quality means for their educational organisation and what they should consider when guaranteeing assessment quality. Moreover, the study provides researchers with insight into the current state of scientific evidence.

I gleaned several key ideas from this article, both related to the subject matter and to the methods the authors used in their review.

!!! An Aside: [I found this article using the new and very helpful Research Rabbit app on the web](https://researchrabbitapp.com). This is a handy web tool you can use to find related articles. As you build out a list of articles that are highly relevant to your topic of idea, Research Rabbit will find articles related to those as well as highlight past article that are listed as references and later articles that cite the highly relevant articles in your list. I recommend you check it out the next time you need to do a lit review.
