Immediately below the kanban view, I have created collections of links to various components of the task before me.

Moving clockwise from the top left...

### 2-Pagers

My most recent writing has been to construct then distill to 2 pages a research overview to help clarify the `Problem`, `Purpose`, `Methods`, and `Questions` that I am interested in. As you can see, I went through a number of ideas and drafts before getting to v0.1, where I am now. With this 2-pager in hand, I can now speak intelligently to potential internal and external committee members to gauge their interest in being on the committee and also their fit with my questions.

### Lit Review

This is another series of integrated databases that merit their own post. The `Articles` database is a link to all of the articles I have to read, am reading, or have read. While I read, I write. I take notes, pull quotes, note page numbers, add tags, and create hyperlinks. I also create `Key Idea` metadata, which feeds into the `Synthesis Matrix` database.

### Logistics

Under the logistics link is the `Timeline` database which outlines all of the major milestones along the way to graduation. It is currently set to a Gantt chart view, giving me an overview of the whole project.

### Docs

The `Docs` section is a list of links to the timeline items (which are also in the weekly todo list). Each of these items is a page where I will compose my drafts.

### Links, Random, and Archive

These spots are a little bare right now, and it's likely you can figure out what they are for.
