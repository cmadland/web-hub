#### Feature - Inclusivity and Permeability

It would seem apparent from Kemmis, et al, that *public* spheres cannot be *exclusive*, particularly if the excluded parties are marginalized. Collins provides an example of having to work through this issue during his project when he writes of the fact that the younger students in the class were being sidelined by the older students. He used the situation where both parties had an interest to talk about democracy and participation in the context of playing soccer at recess.


#### Feature - Communicative Freedom

*Cooperative* collaboration usually refers to projects where one party in the project is providing a service to another party, such as professional development. *Symbiotic* arrangements are defined by reciprocity, where each party in the project helps the other. *Organic* collaboration is characterized by projects with jointly-owned issues, where the parties are interdependent on each other for the solution (see Johnson & Johnson (n.d.) for a description of positive interdependence). This organic collaboration, what Whitford terms "boundary-spanning", is similar to the idea in Kemmis et al, that public spheres "presuppose communicative freedom" (p. 43).

The parallel isn't perfect, but in order for a project to truly be *organic* and *boundary-spanning*, per Whitford, there must be a sense that individuals or parties in a project have the freedom and capacity to listen to the other party, and that disparities in "power, reputation, and status" often lead to situations where the powerful dominate the less powerful.
