`gifting` (no expectation of return), `lending` (expectation of return of the item), `sharing` (concurrent use), `commoning` (presumes a common interest and effort in socially maintaining and managing a resource; collective stewardship to ensure sustainability)
- example of commoning - textbook sprint
- librarians are overlooked in curating and commoning
- global open anatomical atlas
- open access, science, data, pedagogy, policy, technology - not just resources
- technology is the piece that enables blending above components
- barriers
  - fear
  - rewards come from competitive processes, not openness and collaboration
- value != money; value is reciprocal in commoning
- open eduction needs a social system to define how open ed will be done
