### Acknowledging the Land and the People

I acknowledge with respect the Lekwungen (Le-KWUNG-en) peoples on whose traditional territories the University of Victoria stands and the Songhees (Song-hees), Esquimalt (Ess-KWY-malt) and the W̱SÁNEĆ (Wa-San-nic) peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

## Problem

^It used to be that assessment practices and understandings of cognition were in alignment. The behaviourists of the early and mid-20th century argued that learning was a matter of rewarding success in a highly atomized knowledge structure. As such, assessing learner knowedge of that structure could be accomplished by determining whether learners could recognize or identify the correct answer to a series of factual questions about the subject. So the use of selected response tests fit well with the model of cognition of the day.

^ However, as our understanding of cognitive processes and learning have advanced beyond the rewards and punishments of behaviourism towards social constructivist practices, assessment practices have remained relatively unchanged. Consequently, there is a misalignment between contemporary assessment practices in higher education and modern understandings of human cognition. Further, given that assessment practices exert profound influence on learners and their experiences of higher education I would like to investigate this misalignment, beginning with understanding instructors foundational beliefs about assessment practices in higher education and then exploring how those beliefs impact learner experiences.

How do we come to know what learners know?

### Validity and Reliability

High-stakes decisions (all grading decisions, really) should have a minimum reliability (co-efficient alpha, formerly known as Cronbach's alpha) of .08.

Recall from this morning's keynote that most teacher-created assessments fall around 0.4...

### Humanizing Assessment

Think +1...

- reduced confidence in 'grades'
- fewer categories of achievement
- more flexibility
- ask learners
- Trust. Learners.
- more equity
