### Acknowledging the Land and the People

I acknowledge with respect the Lekwungen (Le-KWUNG-en) peoples on whose traditional territories the University of Victoria stands and the Songhees (Song-hees), Esquimalt (Ess-KWY-malt) and the W̱SÁNEĆ (Wa-San-nic) peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

^It used to be that assessment practices and understandings of cognition were in alignment. The behaviourists of the early and mid-20th century argued that learning was a matter of rewarding success in a highly atomized knowledge structure. As such, assessing learner knowedge of that structure could be accomplished by determining whether learners could recognize or identify the correct answer to a series of factual questions about the subject. So the use of selected response tests fit well with the model of cognition of the day.

^ However, as our understanding of cognitive processes and learning have advanced beyond the rewards and punishments of behaviourism towards social constructivist practices, assessment practices have remained relatively unchanged. Consequently, there is a misalignment between contemporary assessment practices in higher education and modern understandings of human cognition.

^Complicating the challenge is the trend, accelerated by COVID-19, towards greater use of technologies in higher ed and the pressures from employers who are looking for graduates who display competence in creative and divergent thinking, not only recall or recognition of content knowledge.

^Finally, assessment practices exert profound influence on learners and their experiences of higher education, so, taken together, I would like to investigate this misalignment, beginning with understanding instructors foundational beliefs about assessment practices in higher education and then exploring how those beliefs impact learner experiences.

# Purpose

> The purpose of this research is to investigate current frameworks in assessment literacy and assessment practices among higher education instructors and the impacts of those on learners.

---

# Questions

- Are there distinct patterns in higher education instructors’ approaches to assessment in Canada?
- Does the prevalence of these patterns differ by:
  - instructors’ levels of experience in teaching face-to-face versus online?
  - instructors’ levels of experience using technology?

---

# Questions

- What factors influence instructors’ approaches to assessment?
- How do different assessment strategies affect learners’ experiences?

# Theoretical Framework

^Since 1990, there have been several frameworks proposed for modelling the assessment skills or dispositions necessary for educators. Initial frameworks were published for the K-12 context in the form of sets of standards for high quality assessment practices. These sets of standards were often grounded in behaviourist perspectives of teaching and learning and eventually became outdated. Modern views have evolved to include the idea of assessment literacy as a multi-dimensional construct with a wide variety of influences. Contrary to K12 contexts, though, it seems that a framework for understanding assessment literacy among higher ed instructors should consider their general lack of formal preparation for teaching or assessing learning (Lipnevich et al., 2020; Massey et al., 2020).[[OB1\]](#_msocom_1)

^As a theoretical framework, I draw on DeLuca et al's work in *Approaches to Classroom Assessment* which is reflective both of modern conceptions of pedagogy and also of the multi-dimensional nature of assessment beliefs and practices in classrooms. DeLuca et al.'s model consists of four themes of assessment literacy, each with three dimensions. The four themes are 'Assessment Purpose', 'Assessment Process', Assessment Fairness, and Assessment Theory.

# Assessment Purpose

- Assessment *of* Learning
- Assessment *for* Learning
- Assessment *as* Learning

^The first theme, assessment purpose, comprises three dimensions: assessment of learning, assessment for learning, and assessment as learning. Assessment of learning is also known as summative assessment involving instructors gathering evidence of learning from written tests, performance tests, or other situations where learners are required to demonstrate their achievement of the learning outcomes. Assessment of learning usually leads to the assignment of a final grade. Assessment for learning is focused on both instructors and learners acquiring information about their performance that leads to formative feedback that informs future learning activities. The final dimension is assessment as learning which reflects activities which encourage learners to take metacognitive approaches to future learning activities based on the data gathered in learning activities.



---



# Assessment Processes

- Design
- Use and Scoring
- Communication

^The second theme, assessment process, relates to the logistics of creating, scoring, and communicating the results of assessments. Assessment design is the creation of reliable assessments and items intended to provide evidence with which instructors can infer learning in relation to learning outcomes. Use and scoring relates to the protocols instructors use to score learning data, and communication is the process of inferring achievement and communicating that to learners.



---



# Assessment Fairness

- Standard
- Equitable
- Differentiated

^The assessment fairness theme focuses on the beliefs of instructors regarding issues of fairness and whether they take a standard approach where all learners are treated equally, an equitable approach where learners with formally identified needs (psychoeducational diagnoses...) are provided with differentiated protocols, and a differentiated approach where all learners' unique needs are addressed.



---



# Assessment Theory

- Consistent
- Contextual
- Balanced

^Assessment theory is the theme that addresses instructors' knowledge and application of assessment theory. A consistent approach is demonstrated in ensuring consistency in the design, development and scoring of assessments (reliability), a contextual approach ensures the assessment is measuring what it purports to measure (validity of inferences), and a balanced approach considers both the reliability and validity of assessments.
