As such, assessing learner knowedge of that structure could be accomplished by determining whether learners could recognize or identify the correct answer to a series of factual questions about the subject. So the use of selected response tests fit well with the model of cognition of the day.

# Questions

- Are there distinct patterns in higher education instructors’ approaches to assessment in Canada?
- Does the prevalence of these patterns differ by:
  - instructors’ levels of experience in teaching face-to-face versus online?
  - instructors’ levels of experience using technology?

# Questions

- What factors influence instructors’ approaches to assessment?
- How do different assessment strategies affect learners’ experiences?

# Theoretical Framework

^Since 1990, there have been several frameworks proposed for modelling the skills or dispositions necessary for educators, usually focussed on
