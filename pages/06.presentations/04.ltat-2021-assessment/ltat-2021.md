### Acknowledging the Land and the People

I acknowledge with respect the Lekwungen (Le-KWUNG-en) peoples on whose traditional territories the University of Victoria stands and the Songhees (Song-hees), Esquimalt (Ess-KWY-malt) and the W̱SÁNEĆ (Wa-San-nic) peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.

### Context

^As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, my previous dissertation topic became impossible, but the resulting pivot to emergency remote teaching in the spring of 2020 laid bare many of the systemic inequities of higher ed in Canada. Since then, I have come to believe that assessment beliefs and practices can be powerful drivers for progress for the benefit of learners, or for hegemony and the status quo.

^This presentation is derived from my literature review supporting my dissertation project on assessment in higher education. I welcome your thoughts and questions.

^How do we come to know what learners know?

### Validity and Reliability

High-stakes decisions (all grading decisions, really) should have a minimum reliability (co-efficient alpha, formerly known as Cronbach's alpha) of .08, however...

### The Problem with Percentages

^Assume 4 learners in a course with 4 equally-weighted graded assessments. You need to make decisions about their success in your course. You run your calculations and all 4 learners earn the same final percentage.

^Each learner scores 75% in the final tally of grades, and this is the single number reported to the Registrar. What does that number tell us? What does it possibly hide?

^Learner A's ability might seem to match their final grade, perhaps providing evidence that 75% is a good measurement of their true ability.

^Learner B has a very different performance profile, starting out poorly, but finishing well.

^Learner C has the exact opposite profile to Learner B...

^Learner D started out dismally...what will they need to do to earn 75%?

^All they need to do is ace every subsequent assignment to recover a decent grade. So...what things might be hidden in this data? Which learner might not have been able to afford the textbook until after the midterm? Which learner might have experienced the loss of a significant relationship? Which learner might have coasted despite being much more capable? Which learner might have been victim of a 'No make-up exams; no exceptions', or a 'No late assignments; no exceptions' rule? Who learned the most? Who learned the least? But most importantly, whose grade was affected by factors unrelated to their actual ability?

### Humanizing Assessment

Think +1...

- reduced confidence in 'grades'
- fewer categories of achievement
- more flexibility
- ask learners
- Trust. Learners.
- more equity
