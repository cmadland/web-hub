# Acknowledging the Land and the People

The University of Alberta respectfully acknowledges that we are located on Treaty 6 territory and Homeland of the Métis, a traditional gathering place for diverse Indigenous peoples including the Cree, Blackfoot, Métis, Nakota Sioux, Iroquois, Dene, Ojibway/ Saulteaux/Anishinaabe, Inuit, and many others whose histories, languages, and cultures continue to influence our vibrant community.

Additionally, I wish to acknowledge the devastating discovery of 215 residential school children very close to where I was born in Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc territory.
